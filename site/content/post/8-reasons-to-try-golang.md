**Ten Reasons to Try Golang**

The Go programming language has steadily gained popularity over the last few years. I’ve been asked for my top reasons why someone should consider Golang, so I thought I’d write them down.

*A few notes:*

This is an opinion piece, not a technical review of the language. The focus here is on the pros of Golang for Software Engineers.

I’m obviously very positive about Go. If you’re looking for a more critical view, you’ll need to look elsewhere.

This is not intended as an exhaustive list of everything that you could do with Go. The Go community and ecosystem are constantly changing and growing, and there are so many ways to use the language, many of which haven’t even been discovered yet.

* **Compiled language.**  

Go is a compiled language, which means that source code must be translated into machine code before it can run. This makes for a fast running program that does not suffer from the execution delays of a language like Python or Ruby. While this translation step takes time, Go programs often run faster than other compiled languages because the translation step is simpler than for more complex languages like Java or C++.

* **Garbage collected memory.**

Go uses a garbage collector to manage memory allocation for its variables; the programmer need not concern herself with de-allocating memory upon variable declaration. This relieves the programmer from a significant burden and eliminates entire classes of errors.

* **Simple Syntax**

Go is a simple, straightforward language with a syntax similar to C. You'll write code faster, with fewer bugs.

* **Performance**

Go is fast. It's compiled so you don't have to pay for the runtime overheads of a JIT-compiler, and memory management is built-in so you don't have to be concerned about it. A clean slate design also means less time waiting for new releases of libraries and frameworks.

* **Concurrency**

By leveraging the CSP-style concurrency model, Go gets multi-core performance without requiring mutable shared state and data races.

* **It’s simple**

What makes Golang great is that it’s a clean and lean language. It’s a minimal set of tools for building software that leaves out the noise. The simplicity and cleanliness makes it easy to read and understand what’s happening.

* **It’s easy to deploy**

Deploying Go code is also easy and fast. You can treat Go applications as any other binary application and package them as tarballs, docker images, gists or anything else that works for you.

* **It has a simple package system**

How Go handles packages is extremely nice. The go get command is simple and powerful.
